* DONE For a random game, can the user team be picked or is it /always/ added?
* DONE User team can be given by gui as team "Tu Equipo". Ensure we don't overwrite its player list
* DONE Implement calculate_player_affinities [[./structs/players.py::77][HERE]]

* DONE Ensure cards, faults, and goals are calculated and stored properly

* DONE Fix Goals
* TODO Implement choice to use simple teams, i.e. with given hope instead of calculating it
* TODO Player graph query menu

* CURRENT:
- Integrate player-graph into games


* Decisions:
1) If user team is not complete, empty spaces are filled in randomly
2) Implemented list using setattr and getattr through an attribute =_n= for each 'index' n. Similarly for dicts, where =_h= is now a hash if applicable.
3) Initially implemented lists and dicts using setattr and getattr for fast access but this used dictionaries under the hood. We reimplemented the list as a sequence of items a-la linked list, and user dicts have lost the 'advantage' of speed
