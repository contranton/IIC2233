# **Not in a fully working state**

Menu systems have been implemented but issues remain with navigation between them.
I must add default cancellation options for each menu type.
2.5/4 of the main menus must still be implemented to have the program more or less follow the guideline.

Many things are broken right now! Avert your eyes for the sake of your sanity until I eventually refactor this mess!
